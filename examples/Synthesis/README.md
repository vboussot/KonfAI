# Synthesis Example

This example shows how to run a complete **medical image synthesis workflow** with KonfAI in its low-level, YAML-driven mode.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vboussot/KonfAI/blob/main/examples/Synthesis/Synthesis_demo.ipynb)

It is the best starting point if you want to understand how KonfAI combines:

- configuration files
- local custom Python modules
- training
- prediction
- evaluation

The default workflow is built around **MR to CT synthesis**, but the same structure can be adapted to **CBCT to CT** or other paired image-to-image tasks.

## What you will find in this folder

```text
examples/Synthesis/
├── Config.yml
├── Config_GAN.yml
├── Prediction.yml
├── Evaluation.yml
├── Model.py
├── README.md
├── Synthesis_demo.ipynb
└── UnNormalize.py
```

- `Config.yml`: training workflow
- `Config_GAN.yml`: GAN training workflow with a 2D generator and a 3D discriminator
- `Prediction.yml`: shared inference workflow for both the baseline checkpoint and the generator extracted from a GAN checkpoint
- `Evaluation.yml`: shared evaluation workflow for both synthesis variants
- `Model.py`: local model module defining the baseline `UNetpp5`, the `Discriminator`, and the full `Gan`
- `UnNormalize.py`: example of a local custom postprocessing transform

## Recommended way to start

If you only want to get KonfAI running once and understand the folder structure:

1. download the demo dataset
2. run training
3. run prediction on the same dataset
4. run evaluation
5. inspect `Checkpoints/`, `Predictions/`, and `Evaluations/`

If you prefer a guided walkthrough, open:

- `Synthesis_demo.ipynb`

The notebook is designed to work from a **fresh environment**, including **Google Colab**. Its first setup cells can:

- clone the KonfAI repository if needed
- install KonfAI and its Python dependencies
- download the public demo subset automatically

## Demo dataset

The public demo dataset is hosted on Hugging Face:

- `https://huggingface.co/datasets/VBoussot/konfai-demo`

If you want a notebook-driven first run, use `Synthesis_demo.ipynb`.

If you prefer to fetch the demo subset manually, use the Hugging Face CLI:

```bash
python -m pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
hf download VBoussot/konfai-demo \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --include "Synthesis/**" \
  --local-dir Dataset
mv Dataset/Synthesis/* Dataset/
rmdir Dataset/Synthesis
rm -rf Dataset/.cache
```

After that, your local layout should look like:

```text
examples/Synthesis/
├── Dataset/
│   ├── CASE_001/
│   │   ├── MR.mha
│   │   ├── CT.mha
│   │   └── MASK.mha
│   └── ...
├── Config.yml
├── Config_GAN.yml
├── Prediction.yml
├── Evaluation.yml
├── Model.py
└── UnNormalize.py
```

Dataset groups used by the example:

- `MR`: model input
- `CT`: ground-truth target
- `MASK`: mask used for preprocessing and masked evaluation

## Quick start

Run all commands from this directory:

```bash
cd examples/Synthesis
```

For the smoothest first run on a fresh machine or in Colab, start with `Synthesis_demo.ipynb`.

### 1. Train

```bash
konfai TRAIN -y --gpu 0 --config Config.yml
```

If you do not have a GPU available, use `--cpu 1` instead of `--gpu 0`.

This creates:

- `Checkpoints/TRAIN_01/`
- `Statistics/TRAIN_01/`

### 2. Predict

Use one checkpoint from `Checkpoints/TRAIN_01/`:

```bash
konfai PREDICTION -y --gpu 0 --config Prediction.yml --models Checkpoints/TRAIN_01/<checkpoint>.pt
```

This creates:

- `Predictions/TRAIN_01/`

### 3. Evaluate

```bash
konfai EVALUATION -y --config Evaluation.yml
```

This creates:

- `Evaluations/TRAIN_01/`

## GAN variant

This folder also contains a second synthesis variant:

- `Config_GAN.yml`
- `Model.py`

The GAN example is useful if you want to understand a more advanced KonfAI pattern:

- a **2D / 2.5D generator**
- a **3D discriminator**
- two different patching levels in the same model graph
- shared prediction and evaluation workflows with the baseline model

Both training variants use the same local `UNetpp5` definition from `Model.py`:

- `Config.yml` trains `Model:UNetpp5` directly
- `Config_GAN.yml` trains `Model:Gan`, which internally contains the same `UNetpp5` generator plus a 3D discriminator

Because the generator class name stays `UNetpp5` in both cases, the same `Prediction.yml` can reload either:

- a baseline checkpoint from `TRAIN_01`
- or the generator weights saved inside a GAN checkpoint from `TRAIN_GAN_01`

### Why there are two patch definitions

In `Config_GAN.yml`, there are two different patching scopes:

- `Dataset.Patch`: the **global 3D patch** given to the whole GAN
- `Model.Gan.UNetpp5.Patch`: the **internal generator patch**

The idea is:

- the full GAN sees a 3D chunk, so the discriminator can judge local 3D realism
- inside that 3D chunk, the generator still works slice-wise with 2.5D context

In practice:

- the dataset patch extracts a chunk like `[16, 320, 320]`
- the generator patch reprocesses that chunk as `[1, 320, 320]` with `extend_slice: 4`
- this gives the generator a 2D prediction target with neighboring slices as context

### What `;accu;` means here

The `;accu;` marker refers to the **patch-wise outputs before re-assembly**.

That matters in the GAN example:

- `Generator_A_to_B:;accu;Head:Tanh` is used for the generator reconstruction loss
- `Discriminator_pB:Head:Conv` is used after the generator output has been re-assembled as a 3D chunk

So the flow is:

1. the generator predicts slice-wise patches
2. KonfAI accumulates and re-assembles them into a 3D chunk
3. the 3D discriminator receives that assembled fake chunk

This is the key semantic difference between the baseline and the GAN variant.

### GAN commands

Train the GAN variant:

```bash
konfai TRAIN -y --gpu 0 --config Config_GAN.yml
```

Predict from the generator weights saved inside the GAN checkpoint with the shared prediction workflow:

Before running prediction, set `train_name` in `Prediction.yml` to `TRAIN_GAN_01` so the outputs are written to the right folder.

```bash
konfai PREDICTION -y --gpu 0 --config Prediction.yml --models Checkpoints/TRAIN_GAN_01/<checkpoint>.pt
```

Then evaluate the GAN predictions with the shared evaluation workflow:

Before running evaluation, update `Evaluation.yml` so both `train_name` and the prediction folder point to `TRAIN_GAN_01`.

```bash
konfai EVALUATION -y --config Evaluation.yml
```

## Pretrained models

If you want to test inference without training from scratch, you can use pretrained models from:

- `https://huggingface.co/VBoussot/Synthrad2025`
- `https://huggingface.co/VBoussot/ImpactSynth`

The `Synthrad2025` repository contains challenge checkpoints that can be used as examples of ensemble prediction.

## What this example demonstrates

This example is useful because it shows several important KonfAI patterns in one place:

- a custom model loaded through `classpath`
- a custom postprocessing transform
- patch-based training and prediction
- a GAN variant with nested patching scopes
- shared prediction and evaluation across baseline and GAN checkpoints
- patch-wise outputs exposed through `;accu;`
- masked evaluation
- train / prediction / evaluation split across dedicated YAML files

## What to adapt for your own project

The first fields you will usually change are:

1. `dataset_filenames`
2. input and target groups
3. preprocessing transforms
4. patch size
5. batch size
6. model class and model hyperparameters
7. losses and monitored metrics
8. `train_name`

## Notes

- This example is intended for **workflow understanding and experimentation**.
- If you want a simpler user-facing interface for a mature workflow, the next step is usually to package it as a **KonfAI App**.
- For a ready-to-use synthesis app, see `apps/impact_synth`.
